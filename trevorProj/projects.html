      Due to the pandemic, several projects have been put on hold.<br />We plan
      on returning to our previous level of operation when the safety of all GCU
      students involved can be guaranteed.<br />This page contains all
      project(s) that are still in the works!<br /><button

        <br />
        <p id="special-id">
          This seemingly inconspicuous arcade cabinet is actually a project in
          the works for the IxT club! Club members are working to turn this
          dusty arcade cabinet into a prime gaming machine for all to enjoy
          within the GCU eSports Arena. The arcade cabinet will run off of a
          Raspberry Pi equipped with a RetroPie OS to manage its library of
          classic arcade games. There are plans to connect the arcade machine to
          a Twitch API that will stream the games played on screen to the
          internet! A camera will be mounted onto the machine that will catch
          video of players competing for bragging rights or just having some
          casual fun! We hope that we can host weekly tournaments for GCU
          students to participate in playing classic titles such as Street
          Fighter II, Tekken, and more!

        <br />
        <p>
          The Havoc Badge is a new way to get involved with GCU's sporting
          events! The Havocs shine like stars as their sleek and sharp badges
          light up the stands! Syncing with real time events, these sleek and
          sharp emblems can change color and patterns to the music being played!
          When badges are put together, they can even display images and
          animations! When not used at GCU related events, these stylish badges
          still prove useful as they can display different colors/patterns using
          the button located at the front.
