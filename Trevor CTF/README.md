This site will be used by GCU Cyber students(and possibly cyber student across the nation) to test their hacking skills in a competition called a CTF (Capture The Flag).
The plan is to deploy the site at GCU to test it, gather feedback, improve on it, and then release it as an online competition that schools across the nation could participate in.
It is fully responsive and uses CSS media queries.
Languages used: HTML, CSS, JS
Plans to implement SQL database with PHP on the backend.
