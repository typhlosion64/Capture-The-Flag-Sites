        The Information x Technology club (IxT) is the official club of the
        College of Technology here at GCU! IxTâ€™s mission is to celebrate and promote
        interest and innovation in every field of technology. Our goal is to
        cultivate an environment for like-minded students to pursue their
        interests and share their passions by engaging in projects,
        learning, and with the community. We do so by working with different organizations such as
        Black Hat, DEFCON, Girls Who Code, ISACA, Cactus Con and many more!<br><br> We
        aim to prepare students for highly successful careers in the technology
        industry by supplying opportunities to gain industry connections and
        leadership experience. We encourage technological innovation and work to
        expose our members to diverse disciplines. Additionally, we strive to
        use our knowledge to provide excellent service within our local
        community.<br>Interested?<br>
