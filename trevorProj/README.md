# First CTF Site
The first website I have ever made for GCU's CTF initiative.
Started with my friend, Trevor (President of the GCU Technology Club), the goal of the project is to provide cyber security challenges to aspiring cyber student across the nation.
This site masquerades as an official site for the GCU Technology Club (formerly known as IxT), but has several vulnerabilities and secrets for hackers to discover.
It has been deployed at Peoria High School in Arizona in collaboration with the MET Professional Academy.
